    <h3>The primitive types in JS are: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Number - A 64 bit floating point</li>
        <li>Boolean</li>
        <li>String</li>
        <li>Undefined</li>
        <li>Symbol</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The other data types are</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Object</li>
        <li>Function</li>
        <li>Array</li>
        <li>Date</li>
        <li>Error</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>There are two ways to check for equality in Javascript</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Double Equals - Relational operator that returns true if and only if both operands have the same value. There is also !=. Type coercion is performed. </li>
        <li>Triple equals is a relational operator that returns true if and only if both operands of the same type and value. There is also !==.</li>
    </ol>


    <p>Falsey refers to any value that is not the boolean <em>false</em>, however, it evaluates to false.</p>
    <p>Values that are falsey include</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Empty string</li>
        <li>Number 0</li>
        <li>Null</li>
        <li>Undefined</li>
        <li>NaN</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Null and undefined are not equal to anything but themselves.</p>
    <p>NaN is not equivalent to anything, including itself.</p>
    <p>Every other value is truthy.</p>


    <h3>We can use the typeof operator to determine the type of its operand</h3>

    <h3>The different variable scopes in javascript are: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Global</li>
        <li>Local</li>
        <li>Block</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Functions in Javascript are special.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>They can be assigned in one of three ways. Declared function, Function as a value, and Arrow Functions</li>
        <li>They are objects.</li>
        <li>They can be anonymous</li>
        <li>They can be hoisted</li>
        <li>They can be self-invoking.</li>
        <li>They can be used as callback functions.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <h3>New in Ecmascript 6</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Template literals. These are strings created using the ES6 backticks. Which allow for the interpolation of javascript expressions inside strings.</li>
        <li>Arrows Functions: Provide a shorter syntax than the declaration of a function. Arrows functions however, are necessary because they inherit the 'this' value of the enclosing context.</li>

    </ul>
