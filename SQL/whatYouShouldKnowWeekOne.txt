What is JavaScript?
A client-side, interpreted language that is understood by web browsers and used alongside
HTML to make dynamic web pages. Is dynamically typed, object oriented

What are the data types?
Primitive- Boolean, number, string, null, undefined, symbol

How can objects be created in JavaScript?
var name = value pairs;
var name = {name1: value1, name2: value2}

What makes functions in JavaScript different from other languages?
functions are objects, can be anonymous, can be self-invoking, can be hoisted, callback functions

What is truthy and falsy?
falsy- evaluate to false but isn't the boolean false
"",0,undefined,NaN, null are all falsy
undefined and null are only equal to each other
NaN is equal to nothing, not even itself
truthy- evaluate to true but isn't the boolean true

What is the purpose of isNaN?
checks whether any value is NaN (illegal number)

Is JavaScript pass by value or pass by reference?
always pass by value, when a variable refers to an object, the "value" is a reference to the object

What are undeclared variables and undefined variables?
undeclared- does not use var, created on global object even if initialized in another scope
undefined- call a variable/function without creating it

What are the variable scopes in JavaScript?
global- variables defined not in any function/block
local- variables defined in function in which it was declared
block- variables defined in the block it was declared

What are global variables?
variables defined so that they can be accessed anywhere in the file

How do you add new elements dynamically?
var btn = document.createElement("Button")
var t = document.createTextNode("Click me")
btn.appendChild(t)
document.body.appendChild(btn)

What is the difference between == and ===?
==: returns true if both operands have same value, performs type coercion
===: returns true if both operands are of same type and have same value, does not perform type coersion

How would one submit a form using JavaScript?
document.getElementById("myForm").submit()

What is an event in JS? What are some common events?
A reaction to some user input
onclick, onmoueover, onmouseout, onsubmit, onload

What is an event listener?
event listener will listen for an event to occur on a specified tag, and invoke the provided callback function

What is the difference between bubbling and capturing?
bubbling: execution of events from the innermost tags to the outermost
capturing: outermost to innermost

What is strict mode?
restricted version of JS, changes silent errors to throw errors, faster

In what ways can you get references to HTML elements programmatically?
document.getElementById()
document.getElementsByTagName()
document.getElementsByClassName()
document.querySelector()
document.querySelectorAll()

What are the four pillars of OOP?
Abstraction- centralizing common characteristics into conceptual objects/classes
Polymorphism- "taking on many forms", method overriding
Inheritance- extending a parent object's functionality, prototypal inheritance
Encapsulation- restricting the access and modification of an object's state

Is JavaScript an Object Oriented Programming language?
Yes

How do we achieve encapsulation in JavaScript?
Through the use of closures (combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared)
functions within functions

How do we achieve inheritance in JavaScript?
using parent class .prototype

Can functions be overloaded?
No
Can functions be overridden?
Yes

What is JSON?
JavaScript Object Notation, a safe and reliable data interchange format
A string representation of a JS object, which is easily readible by human/machine
Allows for objects, arrays, numbers, strings, and booleans to be serialized
JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse()

What is AJAX? What is the AJAX workflow?
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
Used to update data on a webpage by using asynchronous data between the client and the server without
the need to refresh the page
Relatively new technique which allows for web systems and applications to be better, faster, and more
interactive
1. Declare and instantiate an XMLHttpRequest()
	let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
2. Define a function to the xhr.onreadystatechange property to handle the reponse
	xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){
		//do stuff
	}
3. We call xhr.open(), which takes the HTTP method as its first argument and the URL endpoint as its second
4. We call xhr.send() to send the request to the server specified in the URL
5. If the response was received, the onreadystatechange call back function will handle the response
using xhr.responseText ==> returns the server response as a string

What are the important XMLHttpRequest properties?
onreadystatechange, responseTest

What are the different values of readyState?
0 = unsent, 1 = opened, 2 = headers_received, 3 = loading, 4 = done

What are some advantages of using AJAX?
Bandwidth utilization: memory is saved when the data is fetched from the same page
More interactive, data retrieved quicker

What are some disadvantages of using AJAX?
AJAX is fully dependent on JS, if there is a problem on browser of OS, no AJAX
JSON source code is easily human readable, it follows that there could be some security issues
Use of AJAX increases the size of HTTP requests
Provides problems using back button in AJAX heavy web pages

What is HTTP?
HyperText Transfer Protocol, predefined set of codes that is sent by the server to indicate whether
a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed

What is an HTTP status code?
1xx- informational, 2xx- success, 3xx- redirect, 4xx- client-side erro, 5xx- server-side error

What is the difference between GET and POST?

What are the five sublanguages of SQL?
1. DDL (Data Definition Language)- CREATE, DROP, ALTER, RENAME, TRUNCATE
2. DQL (Data Query Language)- SELECT
3. DML (Data Manipulation Language)- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
4. TCL (Transaction Control Language)- COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT
5. DCL (Data Control Language)- GRANT, REVOKE

What are the different constraints?
not-null, unique, primary, foreign, default, check

What is cascade delete?
What are some common commands/clauses and their syntax (I gave you a cheat sheet)?
What are the different relationships? (Multiplicity)? How do you enforce the different relationships?
What is an Entity Relational Diagram?
What is a subquery?
What is referential integrity?
What is an orphaned record?
What is an aggregate function/scalar function?
What is a join?
What are the different joins available?
What are the difference between the joins?
What is the purpose of LIKE?
What is the purpose of DISTINCT?
What is the purpose of SELECT INTO?
What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?
What is the difference between DELETE, DROP, and TRUNCATE?
