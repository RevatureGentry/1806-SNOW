    <h2>As we know, Inheritance is achieved in JavaScript through Prototypal Inheritance.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Every object has a prototype. And every prototype has a prototype. So on, and so forth, until it reaches Object.prototype</li>
        <li>The very top of the Prototypal Inheritance chain? Believe it or not, null</li>
        <li>When a property gets accessed on an object in JavaScript (either state or behavior), JS looks on the object for that property first.</li>
        <li>If the property is not found on the object, JS checks the object's prototype.</li>
        <li>If the property is not on the object's prototype, JS checks the prototype of the prototype, and so on</li>
        <li>If we want to add state or behavior to an object, we have to add it to the object's prototype</li>
    </ul>
