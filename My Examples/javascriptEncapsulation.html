    <h2>Encapsulation is the OOP principle that restricts access of and prevents change of an object's data members</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In JavaScript, we use Closures to achieve Encapsulation</li>
        <li>A Closure, as we know, is an inner function that has access to its enclosing function's variables</li>
        <li>What if I told you we already have created a Closure?</li>
    </ul>
