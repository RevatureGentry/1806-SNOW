    - Agenda:
        - Introduction
        - Objectives
        - Why Service Management
        - Core ITSM Disciplines
        - Disciplines Overview
- What is Service?
    - A service is a means a delivering value to the customer by facilitating the
        outcomes that customer want to achieve without the ownership of specific costs
        and risks.
    - IT Service: is a set of IT-related function (Hardware & Software)
        - Users - Web Server - Application Server - Database Server
- What is IT Service Management
    - ITSM is a process based practice intended to align the delivery of IT services with
        needs of the organization, emphasizing benefits to customers
    - ITSM refers to the entirety of activities - directed by policies, organized and structured
        in processes and supporting procedures - that are performed by an organization to design,
        plan, deliver, operate and control TI services offered to customers
    - It is thus with the implementation of IT serves that meet customers needs and it is
        performed by the IT service provider through  an appropriate mix of people, processes, and IT
- IT Service Management Objectives
    - To align IT services with the current and future needs of the business and its customers
    - To improve the quality of the IT services delivered
    - To reduce the long term cost of service provision
                    Needs
                /           \
            Cost  -------- Quality
- Why Service Management?
    - Increasing demand from Business to deliver effective IT solution/services (Cost effective)
    - Increasing competition
    - Increasing pressure to realize return on investment
    - Increasing complexity of IT infrastructure and processes
    - Increasing IT Visibility
- Core ITSM Disciplines
    - Service Support 
        - Day-to-Day operational support of IT services
    - Service Delivery
        - Long term planning and improvement of IT service provision 
- Some Key Definitions:
    - Customer: recipient of a service -- usually the Customer management has responsibility for the
        funding of the service
    - Provider: the unit responsible for the provision of IT service 
    - Supplier: a third party responsible for supplying or supporting underpinning elements of the 
        IT service 
    - User: person using the service on a daily basis (umbrella term)
- Problem vs. Incident: problem is a repeated incident, problem is the root cause of the incident
- Change: a modification; Normal, Standard, Emergency : knowing & providing the solution to a inc/prob,
- Release Management: presenting new versions of a certain product
- Resolution Time: time it takes to solve the problem
- Response Time: time to get from a help desk to get help
- ITIL: IT Infrastructure Theory
- Agenda
    - Introduction
    - Roles
    - ITL Service Life Cycle
        - Service Strategy: strategy generation/financial management/service portfolio management/demand mgmt
        - Service Design: capacity, availability, infor security mgmt/service level & supplier mgmt
        - Service Transition: planning & support/ released & deployment/asset & config mgmt, change mgmt/knowledge mgmt
        - Service Operation: problem & incident mgmt/request fulfillment/event & access mgmt
        - Continual Service Improvements: service measurement & reporting/ 7 step improvement process
- What is ITIL?
    - IT Instrastructure Theory is a set of detailed practices for IT service management (ITSM) that focuses
        focuses on aligning IT services with the needs of business 
    - Systemic apporach to HQ IT Service Delivery 
    - Public Body for the knowledge of Service Management best practices 
    - Helps orgs. to promive service level and reduce the cost of IT operations 
    - A framework, defining ten interlokcing processes for Service Support and Service Delivery 
    - ITIL V3 Foundation, ITIL Practioner,  ITIL Expert are the main certifications
- Ten core processes of ITIL (...and one function):
- Roles: collection of specific responsibilities and privileges...roles may be held by individuals or teams...
    individuals and teams may hold more than one role 
    - ITIL emphasizes a number of standard roles include, most importantly: 
        - Service Owner: accountable for the overall, design, performance, integration, improvement
            and management of a single service 
        - Process Owner: accountable for the overall design, performance integration, improvement and 
            and amangement of a single process 
        - Service Manager: accountable for the developement, performance and improvement of all service in an 
            environment 
        - Product Manager: accountable for the developement, performance improvement of the entire product 
- Service Strategy:
    - What are we going to provide? / Can we afford it? / Can we provide enough of it? / ... Perspective, Plan, Pattern
        - Define Market / Develop Offering / Develop Strategic Assets / Prepare for Execution
- Demand Management
    - ensures we don't waste money with excess capacity 
    - ensures we have enough capacity to meet demand at agreed quality 
- Service Design 
    - how to provide / how to build / how to test / how to deploy
- Process in Service Design 
    - availability mgmt, capacity mgmt, ITSCM (disaster recovery), Supplier mgmt, Service Level mgmt,
        info security mgmt, service catalogue mgmt
- Service Level Management 
    - Agreements 
        - Service Level Agreements (Service Provider and Customer)
            - Service Desc/Hrs of Operation/User Response times/Incident Response times/Resolution times/
                avaialbility & continuity targets/customer resp. / critical operational periods/ change resp. times
        - Operational Level Agreements (Internal between two teams)
        - Underpinning Contracts (Vendor and Service Provider)
            no agreements between Vendor and Customer, doesn't exist
    - Success of SLM (KPIs - Key Performance Indicators)
        - how many services have SLA?
        - How does the number of breaches of SLA change over time (we hope it reduces!) 
- Right Capacity, Right Time, Right Cost! (capacity mgmt)
    - balances cost against capacity so minimizes cost while maintaining qual of service 
- ITSCM (IT Service Continuity Management)
    - ensures resumption of services within agreed timescale
    - business impact analysis informs decisions about resources
         - Stock Exchange can't afford 5 min downtime but 2 hrs downtime probably won't badly affect
            a departmental accounts office
- Information Security mgmt
    - Confidentiality (making sure only authorizes users can see data)
    - Integrity (making sure the data is accurate and not corrupte)
    - Availiability (making sure data is supplied when it's requested)
- Service Transition
    - Build / Deployment / Testing / User Acceptance / Bed-in
- Good Service Transition 
    - Set customer expectations
    - Enable release integration 
    - Reduce performance variation 
    - Document and reduce known errors 
    - Minimize risk 
    - Ensure proper use of services
- Change Mgmt and types 
    - Change mgmt helps orgs understand + work minimize risks of changes to IT env...essentially a process 
        for managing the people-side of change
    - Normal (non-urgent, req. approval) / Standard (non-urgent, following established path, no approval needed},
    / Emergency (requires approval but too urgent for normal procedure)
- Change Advisory Board
    - Change Manager (VITAL)
    - One or more of:
        customer(user)/user manager, developer(mantainer), expert(consultant), contractor
    CAB considers the 7 Rs MISSING 1 (who RAISED, REASON, RISK, RESOURCES, RESPONSIBLE, RELATIONSHIPS to other changes)
- Release Mgmt
    - Release is a collection of authorised and tested changes ready for deployment 
    - A rollout introduces a release into the live env 
    - Full Release (Office 2007), Delta release (Windows Update), Package (Windows Service Pack)
- Phased or Big Bang? (Transition)
    - Phased release is less painful but more work
    - Deploy can be manual or automatic 
    - Automatic can be push (cannot stop it) or pull (manually accept release)
    - Release Manager will produce a release policy
- Service Operation 
    - Incident Mgmt/ Problem Mgmt / Event Mgmt / Request Mgmt / Access Mgmt
        - incident: mouse not working, fix it ;  request: mouse not working, get me new one
- Function in Service Operation 
    - Service Desk / Technical Mgmt / IT Operations Mgmt / Applications Mgmt 
- Incident Mgmt 
    - Deals with unplanned interruptions to IT Services or reductions in their quality 
    - Failure of a configuration item that has not impacted a service is also an incident (Disk in RAID failure)
    - Reported by: Users / Tech Staff / Monitoring Tools
- Event Mgmt 
    - 3 types of events TODO
- Problem Mgmt 
    - Aims to prevent problems and resulting incidents, minimzes impact of unavoidable incidents,
        eliminates recurring incidents, 
    - Proactive Problem Mgmt: identifies area of potential weakeness / identifies workarounds
    - Reactive Problem Mgmt: identifying underlying cuases of incidents / identifies changes to prevent recurrence
- Access Mgmt 
    - right things for right users at right time
    - Concepts: Access/ Identity (Authentication, AuthN), Rights (Authorization, AuthZ), Service Group, Directory
- Service Desk 
    - Local, Central, Virtual
    - Single point of Contact 
    - Skills for operators: customer focus, articulate, interpersonal skills, understand business, methodical/analytical,
        tech knowledge, multi-lingual
    - Service Desk often seen as the bottom of the pile (but most visible)
- Continual Service Improvement 
    - Focus on Process owners and service owners 
    - Ensures that services mgmt processes continue to support business 
    - Monitor and enhance SLA 
    - PDCA (Plan - Do - Check - Act)
- Service Measurement 
    - Tech (components, MTBF, etc)
    - Process (KPIs - Critical Success Factors)
    - Service (end-to-end, eg. Customer Satisfaction)
    - Why? Validation/Direction/Justify/Intervene

    - Priorization: SNOW uses 3 metrics for determining the other in order incidents are processed 
        - impact: effect on business that an incident
        - urgency: the extent to which's the incident's resolution can bear delay
        - priority:  how quickly the service desk should address the incident
        Impact 1 + urgency 1 = priority 1
        table for calculatirng priority using impact and urgency

PROBLEM MANAGEMENT 
- Overview 
    - Problem Mgmt helps to identify the cause of  an error in the IT infrastructure that is usually reported 
        as occurrences of related incidents; resolving a problem means fixing the error that will stop these 
        incidents from occurring in the future
    - Problem resolution and elimination of a root cause often calls for applying a change to the config item 
        in the existing TI department

- Process: 
    - Raising and Recording Changes: a new change record can be generated in a number of ways: 
        - an IT team member (role: itil) can genetate a change by hand through
            Change -> Create New or clicking New from the change record list 
        - An IT team member (role: itil) can request a change through the Service Catalog 
        - A change can be requested from an incident
        - A change can be requested from a problem
    - If an assignment rule applies, the change will be assigned to the appropriate user or group...otherwise by hand

ASSET MANAGEMENT 
- Agenda:
- Why should organizations implement a Configuration Management Database (CMDB) solution?
    - If organizations must control the process and realities of chage that occur within the infrastructure
    - A CMDB is a repo of config info which enables IT to meet these difficult challenges by centrally managing
        change across IT silos
    - A CMDB also helps orgs implement and maintain ITIL processes as part of an overall IT Service 
        Management strategy.
- Within an org, who typically uses the CMDB and why?
    - There are multiple users of the CMDB within IT orgs 
        - Change and Config managers use the CDMB to plan, manage and assess the risk of changes and confgs 
            across the IT enterprise
        - Service desk analysts can use a CMDB to diagnose the root cause of a service outage by providing 
            insight into the Configuration Items (CI) that supports an affected service
        -TODO
