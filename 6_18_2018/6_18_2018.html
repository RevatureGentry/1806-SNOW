    HTML: Hypertext Markup Language (NOT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE)
        - markup language used to tell browser how to structure a webpage
    - Elements: opening/closing tags, content
    - Attributes: name/value pairs,  provides some metadata
         - gotta put the value in quotes
    - Anatomy of a webpage:
        - Document Type Declaration eg. !DOCTYPE html
            - set of rules HTML document must follow in order for a browser to understand it correctly\
        - <html> </html> 
        - <head> tag: link stylesheets, provide metadata (data about data)
        - <body> tag: we provide the tags which get rendered to the user
    - Elements: Inline vs. Block
        - Block Elements form visible block on page, appear a new line from whatever content went before it
        - Inline Elements are contained within Block Elements
    - Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)
    - CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy)
    - What is the purpose of an HTML form?
        - main point of interaction between user and application
        - allows users to send data to the app
        - Forms comprised of:
            - input
            - buttons (radio, checkbox, )
            - V important attributes: method (HTTP method used to send data eg. GET/POST)
                - action: URL where you send the data off to
    - HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol
        - GET: used to send data through the URL (idempotent)
        - POST: used to send data through the request body (login, create resources) (non-idempotent operation)

    CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (Cascading b/c you can have multiple of these Bad Larries(tm))
        - augments the aesthetic of HTML documents
    - Why use CSS? 
        - Allows for a seperation for concerns between the developer and the designer
        - Allows for consistency in application, centralized location to change styles
    - How can we use CSS? Order of Precedence for CSS Styles marked in []
        - Inline - as an attribute in any HTML tag [1]
        - Internal - inside style tag located in head, located in <head> [2]
        - External - referenced by href, or <link> tag [3]
        - Browser Default [4]
    - 2 Main Building Blocks:
        - Declaration: elements that you want to style
            - tag name, class, id
        - 
    - WAIT, let's talk about Properties and Values
            - properties define what style you want ot change
            - value is how you change the style
