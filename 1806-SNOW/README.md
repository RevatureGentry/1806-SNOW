## Setting up your Environment
* [GitHub](https://github.com)
    1. If you don't already have an account, create one.
        * Your GitHub username needs to be _professional_
    2. We will use GitHub for all class examples and submission of assignments
    3. If you don't already have Git Bash installed, install [this software](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
        * Optionally, in the install wizard, choose the option _Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt_ if you wish to access Git commands from both Git Bash and the Command Prompt
* [Slack](https://slack.com)
    1. If you don't already have an account, create one
    2. Slack will be the main point of communication inside and outside work hours
* __At this point, email me the following__
    * GitHub username
    * The email I receive this from will be the email I invite to slack!
* [SQL Developer](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/index.html)
    * SQL Developer will be the IDE we use for SQL development 
    * Do __NOT__ download the package with the JDK included. It'll just cause a mess..
* [Oracle 11g Database](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/index-092322.html)
    * Oracle 11g Express Edition will be the database we use for SQL development
        * This is a rather large download, please take care to download before Monday morning
    * The download is available towards the bottom of the page 
    * Once downloaded, navigate to the directory where you put Downloads, and navigate to OracleXE112_Win64/DISK1
        * Double click on the 'setup' to start the installation wizard
        * __DO NOT FORGET THE PASSWORD YOU PROVIDE WHEN IT COMES TO THE SYS AND SYSTEM DATABASE ACCOUNTS__
* I will be using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for all Client Side examples
    * Feel free to use any other text editor of your choice - Atom, Sublime, Notepad++, etc
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is a great location for practice
