    <h3>The primitive types in JavaScript are:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>number - a 64 bit floating point</li>
        <li>boolean</li>
        <li>string</li>
        <li>null</li>
        <li>undefined</li>
        <li>symbol</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The other data types include, but are not limited to:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Object</li>
        <li>Function</li>
        <li>Array</li>
        <li>Date</li>
        <li>Error</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>There are two ways to check for equality in JavaScript:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Double Equals => a relational operator that returns true if and only if both operands have
            the same value. Type coersion is performed with this operator. (!= will also type coerce)
        </li>
        <li>Triple Equals => a relational operator that returns true if and only if both operands are 
            both of the same <em>type</em> and have the same <em>value</em>. Type equality is checked first. (!== will not type coerce.)
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Truthy and Falsy</h3>
    <p>"Falsy" refers to any value that is not the boolean <em>false</em>, however, it evaluates to false.<br>
    Values that are "falsy" include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The empty string ''</li>
        <li>The number 0</li>
        <li>null and undefined</li>
        <li>NaN</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Null and undefined are not equal to anything but themselves. <br>
    NaN is not equivalent to anything, including itself. </p>
    <p>Every other value is truthy. If it's technically not true, false, or falsy, it's truthy.</p>

    <h3>We can use the 'typeof' operator to determine what type a certain value is. The returned operand is a string of the type of data.</h3>
    <br><br>
    <h3>The different variable scopes in JavaScript are:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Global - Anything not in the local or block scope. Accessible throughout the entire program.</li>
        <li>Local - Anything within a function's scope/block of code.</li>
        <li>Block - Anything within a block.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>Functions in JavaScript are <i>special.</i></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>They can be assigned in one of three ways:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>As a Declared function</li>
            <li>Function as a value</li>
            <li>As a Arrow function</li>
        </ul>
        <li>They are Objects</li>
        <li>They can be anonymous (nameless)</li>
        <li>They can be hoisted!</li>
        <li>They can be self-invoking: <br>
            Self invoking function syntax is to wrap a function in a set of parenthesis,", 
            "and have a trailing set of parenthesis for any parameter</li>
        <li>They can be used as a callback function (They can be passed as a parameter into another function)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>New in EcmaScript 6:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Template Literals: strings created using ES6 backticks, ``, which allow for the interpolation 
            of JavaScript expressions inside strings. 
        </li>
        <li>Arrow Functions: provide shorter syntax than the Declaration of a Function. Arrow functions 
            are necessary because they inherit the 'this' value of its enclosing context.
        </li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
