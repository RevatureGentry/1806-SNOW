    <h2>As we know, Inheritance is achieved in JavaScript through Prototypal Inheritance.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Every object has a prototype. And every prototype has a prototype. So on, and so forth, until it reaches Object.prototype</li>
        <li>The very top of the Prototypal Inheritance chain? Believe it or not, null</li>
        <li>When a property gets accessed on an object in JavaScript (either state or behavior), JS looks on the object for that property first.</li>
        <li>If the property is not found on the object, JS checks the object's prototype.</li>
        <li>If the property is not on the object's prototype, JS checks the prototype of the prototype, and so on</li>
        <li>If we want to add state or behavior to an object, we have to add it to the object's prototype</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The keywords 'class', 'constructor', 'extends', 'super', and 'static' were introduced in ES6. Although these constructs look like class based
        languages, JavaScript still remains prototype based
    </h2>

    <h3>Attached to this HTML document are examples for both how inheritance was achieved before ES6 (oldSchoolInheritance.js), as well as 
        how we leverage this new set of keywords to achieve inheritance (inheritance.js)
    </h3>
