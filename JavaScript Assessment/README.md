# JavaScript Problem Set

### In this program, the SpecRunner is set up with a suite of Jasmine unit tests.

### This program contains the shells of each function to which it is your job to provide an implementation for.
* Located in the 'src' directory

### Once you believe you have correctly provided the implementation, in the corresponding spec.js file
* Change the keyword 'xdescribe' to 'describe', this tells Jasmine to run the test suite

### Once all of the test suites are passing, make a push into your branch and slack me that you have completed the assignment
